INLS 620 Assignment 3

What I have done:

1. First of all, I did the data cleaning. The data is retrieved from Kaggle and has been used for some ML competetions, so the data is well-structured in the CSV file. There are some missing values in the statistics which are all numeric, and I just assign 0 to these missing values. Also, there are misspelling in the State and City column, for example, "North Carolina" is written in "North Caroli" or "North Carolin0". I used the text facet to exmaine these two columns and corrected all the mistakes.

2. Secondly, I created the Primary Key, a.k.a. unique URI, for each row by combining Season and Player. Because the file contains data of each player from season 2012 to 2017, I could not identify each row with simply the players' names. So the unique URI looks like "season_player name".

3. Thirdly, I edited the RDF skeleton for each row by assigning values to them.  There is a screenshot of an example triple.

4. I wrote 6 test cases in Fuseki and they are:

   ​	4.1 Which player get the most fouls in seaon 2017?

   ​	4.2 What's the line-up of team Dallas Mavericks in season 2017?

   ​	4.3 Who made the most 3 points goals in 2017? Yes, it's Stephen Curry!

   ​	4.4 Who scored the most in team Dallas Mavericks in season 2017?

   ​	4.5 Are there any Tar Heels in NBA in season 2016?

   ​	4.6 There are many guys coming from New York, so which team did they play for in each season?
